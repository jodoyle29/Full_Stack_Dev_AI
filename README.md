# 4990 Project: Full_Stack_Dev_AI
This is an AI project which involves deep learning, computer vision and rule-based inference engine. The objective is to create an AI which can understand the hand-drawn forms and creates full-fledged application with front-end and back-end.


## Run the app

### Dependencies

-   python 3.6+
-   google vision api

### Instructions

1. Copy google cloud key to project root with name gcp-auth.json
2. `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `$ cd src && uvicorn app:app`
4. Access app frontend on local port [8000](http://localhost:8000)
